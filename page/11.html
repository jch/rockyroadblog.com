    <p>If you’re driving a non-European car built since the early 1980’s, then congratulations, because you’re a dummy! Well, at least the automakers think you are. Sad, but true &#8211; just think of all the stupid lights on instrument panels (IP) in new cars. Cars didn’t always come with reminders that the handbrake was on, or that the oil needed to be changed, or that there’s no oil at all. Now, there are lights on the dash to indicate that the headlights are on, and warnings that one of the tires is flat. Unless the driver is blind, deaf, and mute, shouldn’t these things be obvious?</p>
<p>The idiotization of the IP is an extremely dangerous trend. Calibrated gauges have given way to dummy gauges, and some gauges have been flat out replaced with warning lights. A color coding system was developed to let drivers know the urgency level of the warning. Blue and green symbols are usually informational, yellow meant to get it checked soon, and red meant pull over right now. However, the color coded system was lost in translation, and not many drivers recognize what all those symbols and their colors mean. This confusion led to drivers completely ignoring the warnings &#8211; which can become costly.</p>

    <p>For the first Ride of the Month, we start with one of my previous rides.  No, not because I’m a narcissistic young guy who thinks I’m awesome.  I just hope this will spur some readers to submit their own unique rides for others to admire.  If you have a nice whip that you’d like to share with the world, send us a few pictures and a short story!</p>

    <p>I’m sure you’ve heard the saying before, but it won’t hurt to say it again. Truckers are the backbone of this great nation. Everyday, we use things that are delivered by truckers without a second thought. Yet we often feel annoyed when we encounter these unsung heroes on the highway. Whether they’re passing too slowly or cutting us off, we’re too quick to curse out truckers. Next time, take a breath and think about what they have to deal with before becoming irate. After calming down and deciding not to pick a fight, use the truckers code to help them keep you safe.</p>

    <p>Although I&#8217;m a huge fan of diesel pickups, electric vehicles (EV’s) have a few characteristics that I really love. EV motors produce maximum torque at low RPM, meaning lightning-quick stoplight launches. They also produce power more quietly than the combustion engine. For everyday driving, that’s a great boon (though I’d still prefer the basso rumble of a V8 on track days).</p>
<p>Despite all their recent hype though, mainstream EV ownership is still a pipe dream. Their short range and limited recharging stations prevents our road-trip loving nation from adopting them wholeheartedly. However, several new technologies could change that in a heartbeat, if all the bugs are worked out.</p>

    <p>Not to be confused with the American Indian people living in Utah and Colorado, a Ute is a “utility” vehicle &#8211; the U in SUV.  The Ute formula is simple: take a car, rip out everything behind the driver, and jam a truck bed to the back.  You get the utility of a small pickup, but the benefits of a car &#8211; smoother ride, better handling, and increased fuel economy.  Pioneered by the folks Down Under, the Ute was invented when a farmer’s wife asked for “a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays”.  Alas, the Ute has been extinct in the US market since the last Subaru Baja was spotted in the wild sometime circa 2006.  But times are a changing, and even if pig farming has gone out of fashion, automakers have new incentives to reconsider bringing the Ute back stateside.</p>
<p>Before we jump into the reasons and analysis, let’s have Senor Brad Pitt introduce what a Ute is.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UJsX0d_FIqk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, Mr. Pitt didn’t want something bland and boring like a Chrysler.  He wanted something a little more authentic, a little more Mexican.  If we squint between the lines of the script, we could translate “Mexican” to mean “totally awesome”.</p>
<p>And being totally awesome is what bringing the Ute to the US is all about.  The Ute probably won’t win any high volume sales awards, but it does serve as a good halo car and a gateway purchase to a brand.  All manufacturers in the last decade have been trying to capture the imagination of a young buyer.  Once a young buyer is hooked, the idea is to funnel them into more expensive vehicles in the lineup as their lifestyles change.  One can imagine the marketing department hard at work shaping the ideal buyer: handsome, recent college graduate, loves being social and outdoors, wants to stand out and be an individual.  What car can we build to stir his emotions and attract him to our brand?</p>
<p>One of the first answers to this question was the Pontiac Aztec.  In retrospect, the Aztec was not the correct answer.  It flopped terribly in sales and to this day, that infamously boxy bottom continues to haunt it’s original designers.  But the car wasn’t entirely to blame.  As other manufacturers have discovered, it is possible to build a lower volume and inexpensive halo car that attracts younger buyers to a brand.  Honda had their Element, Nissan with it’s highly accoladed Juke, and lest we forget, Toyota created Scion &#8211; an entire sub-brand whose primary mission is to attract buyers into the Toyota family.  The successes of these experiments have varied, but all have drummed up significant buzz and chatter in the media.</p>
<div id="attachment_865" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/09/Ute1.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-865" title="Ute1" src="../wp-uploads/2011/09/Ute1.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">No brainer that a Ute would take the namesake of it’s grandfather “El Camino”</p></div>
<p>GM has a great opportunity on their hands.  They own the Holden brand in Australia, maker of the bonkers HSV Maloo.  It’s got attitude, and the performance to back it up.  Capable of running 168 MPH, it’s got the record for the world’s fastest pickup truck.  Bringing a heavily detuned or modified version of this ute to the US could fill a gap in GM’s current portfolio. Combine an attractive price (less than $20k starting MSRP) with a ute’s utility and unique styling, and first time buyers will have to do a double take.  Let’s hope that GM does their homework and takes a risk.  Who knows, one day, you’ll be able to point out to your driveway and say, “Yeah man, it’s an El Camino”.</p>

    <p>We&#8217;ve made friends with fellow car blogger Matthew over at <a href="http://drivecult.com">DriveCult</a>. The site&#8217;s full of awesome car commentary and reviews,but what grabbed our attention is Matthew&#8217;s long term test of a Ferrari Daytona. We&#8217;re itching to learn more about it, and we&#8217;ll cover the story in our inaugural &#8220;Car Enthusiast Interview&#8221; series post. Here&#8217;s a chance for you to ask questions about what it&#8217;s like to live with a classic super-car, and anything else about Matthew&#8217;s automotive background. If you have a burning question, submit it in the comments and we&#8217;ll fit it into our interview questions next week.  In the meantime, don&#8217;t forget to check out <a href="http://drivecult.com">DriveCult</a>.</p>

    <p>After the events of September 11th, the weekend following Labor Day has been changed for many generations to come. Instead of being a time to catch up with friends and chat about our all-too-short three day holiday weekend, it is a time marked by sober memorials and remembrance. The atrocious events of 9/11/2001 have been forever scarred into the memory of every American. People across the country will pull together to remember strangers who will never be forgotten.</p>

    <p>Unlike most aspiring automotive journalists, Jerry and I both have a soft spot for the family minivan.  Usually, I favor the Honda Odyssey.  They’ve got their share of issues, but their reflexes are a little more responsive.  That being said, no amount of bribery or alcohol would coerce me into buying a 2011+ Odyssey.   The fact that it lags behind its competitors in the powertrain department doesn’t bother me as much as the idiotic styling.  I stay away from these things on the road, because their drivers are surely blind.</p>
<p>So when the lady at Avis Rent-a-Car in Skagway, AK pulled up in a 2011 Toyota Sienna with my name on it, I became the first person to smile at seeing a minivan.  Here was my chance to wring it out on an extended test drive, no salesman attached, and see what my alternative is going to be when I buy a van down the road.  We loaded it up with 6 adults and 2 kids, some light luggage, and aimed for the famed 3293ft White Pass towards Carcross in the Yukon Territory.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Last week, <a href="../2011/08/riddle-the-ultimate-hipster-machine/index.html">we posted a riddle for what a hipster would drive</a>.  Many have speculated in the past on what the perfect hipster machine can be.  There have been good choices, weird choices, and hilarious choices.  We may never know if there really is one true hipster mobile to rule them all.  But what we do know is that there&#8217;s one quirky car that&#8217;ll come closer than others.  Click through the jump to find out our answer.</p>
<div id="attachment_765" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/geomet_92_2_cd_gallery.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-765 " title="92_geo_metro" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/geomet_92_2_cd_gallery.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="1992 Geo Metro XFI" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">1992 Geo Metro XFI - 3 cylinders of pure non-performance</p></div>
<p>Surprised? We were definitely flabbergasted when we first heard the answer.  But after stretching our brains and squinting our eyes, it&#8217;s clear that the Geo Metro checks all the right hipster boxes.  It is authentic in it&#8217;s purpose as an economy car, but incredibly mediocre and unattractive to any normal person.</p>
<div id="attachment_766" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/Metro_rear.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-766  " title="Metro_rear" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/Metro_rear.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nope, doesn&#39;t look any better from the rear</p></div>
<div id="attachment_767" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/metro_interior.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-767  " title="metro_interior" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/metro_interior.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="The Grandfather of Hard Plastics" width="280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Grandfather of Hard Plastics</p></div>
<p>The lowly Metro started life as a Suzuki Cultus in other markets before being transplanted in the US with as a GM product under the Geo name in 1989.  It&#8217;s 1.0L three cylinder engine choked and sputtered all the way up to it&#8217;s 5100 RPM redline to achieve 55 HP.  The particular trim level a real hipster would buy is the detuned XFI.  That&#8217;s not a typo.  The XFI sacrifices six horses to appease the fuel economy gods.  The result: 43 mpg city and 51 mpg highway.  Car and Driver published a comparison review with a 2010 Honda Insight, a 2010 Toyota Prius, and a 1998 Geo Metro.  Guess who won the mileage comparison?</p>
<p>Exterior styling this bland hasn&#8217;t been attempted before or since.  GM likely had a committee dedicated to ensuring the lowest possible list price at the expense of any stylish flair.  A three year old with crayons can probably achieve a design more daring.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s blandness and singularity in purpose is what makes the Metro the best hipster mobile.  The next time you hear an anemic sounding engine pull up alongside you, glance over.  Odds are good the driver will have an ugly haircut and a t-shirt with an ironic print.</p>

    <p>Traditionally, buying a used car has always been a smart financial move. The depreciation on a new car fades faster than that new car smell.  As soon as a shiny new car rolls off the dealer lots, a heavy chunk of money will have already have evaporated.  While many sources will suggest that a car will be fully depreciated in five years, even buying a lightly used one to two year old car will usually yield significant savings from the base price.  Lately however, the good deals have gone missing.  Ben agrees that the market has gone bonkers as well.  Fortunately for us, it’s definitely a sellers market out there.  For example, in April 2010 KBB rated a 2006 Accord with 44k miles to sell for $13,825.  Fast forward to today and 60k miles on the clock.  KBB now lists it for $14,725. In what crazy alternate universe can you buy a car, drive it 16k miles, turn around and sell it for a $900 profit?  Clearly, this is a climate where buyers have to be wary if they want to get a good deal.  Read on to see why prices have gone bonkers, and how you can save some money on your next car.</p>
<h2>Cash for Clunkers</h2>
<p><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/09/cash4clunkers.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-792" title="cash4clunkers" src="../wp-uploads/2011/09/cash4clunkers.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>In an effort to take older vehicles off the road and spur new car purchases and cut down on older car emissions, the federal government implemented a old car buy back program in 2009.  As the name suggests, consumers would be given cash for purchasing a new vehicle if they agreed to scrap their older car.  There were eligibility guidelines for vehicles to qualify, but the program became an overnight success with more than $2.8 billion reimbursed in rebates, and over 690,000 dealer transactions.  While that may be a drop in bucket of the overall number of cars in the US, if you’re looking for an older model truck of SUV, some good buys may have already been sent to the crusher.</p>
<h2>Decreased Supply</h2>
<p><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/09/used_sale.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793" title="used_sale" src="../wp-uploads/2011/09/used_sale.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks to the recession in 2008, many consumers who would have bought a new vehicle have decided to hold on to their cars a little longer.  And who can blame them?  With unstable finances it the horizon, it makes economic sense to keep a good running car that’s paid off rather than to go back to monthly payments.  Unfortunately in 2011, it also means there are fewer cars going off of three year leases available on the used car markets.  The same is true for cars that are bought and paid for.  If no one wants to sell, it’s intuitive when prices are going up.</p>
<h2>Increased Demand</h2>
<div id="attachment_794" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/09/angry-mob.png%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-794  " title="angry-mob" src="../wp-uploads/2011/09/angry-mob.png%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">mob mentality hurts wallets</p></div>
<p>As if the a drop in used car supplies weren’t bad enough, demand has also increased because of the recession.  When the old jalopy finally gives out, many Americans can’t afford to go back on those pricey monthly payments for new cars.  So they look for a used car.  But if everyone decides they want to buy a used car at the same time, it doesn’t take long for sellers and auctions to realize they can command a higher price for the same goods.</p>
<h2>How to Save</h2>
<p><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/09/3367543296_1470ef5247.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-795 alignright" title="3367543296_1470ef5247" src="../wp-uploads/2011/09/3367543296_1470ef5247.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Ideally, it’s best not be rushed into buying anything, especially a purchase as big as a car.  The longer you can wait, and the more you’re willing to walk away from a deal, the less likely you’ll make a regretful buy.  That said, if you’re in a rush to buy a car in the current market, it can be really tough to find one for a reasonable price. With used car prices at record level highs, it may be one of the few times it could be worth weighing the convenience and peace of mind of buying a new car.  If the list price is too high on a new model, your best bets are to look for unpopular models, or finding a new car that’s an older model and trying to cut down on inventory.  As always, if you can manage to maintain your existing car and minimize the damage to your wallet, that’s probably the best bet to financially sanity.  Good luck and happy hunting!</p>
