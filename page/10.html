    <p>Fast paced times and ever-evolving technology has made it hard to keep up with the car market.  It seems like every other week, there is some new rumor or model introduction just around the corner.  This makes it almost impossible to decide when to buy a new car, especially if your current one is still going strong.  After all, who wants to plunk down 30 grand on a discretionary purchase, only to find out months later that they have last year’s news?</p>
<p>Fortunately, carmakers usually have some semblance of predefined schedules for model changes.  For example, Honda cars are typically redesigned every five years (changed from four years for models introduced before the new millenium).  Based on these model cycles and spy shots from around the world, accurate predictions are easy to make these days.  We’ve decided to help consumers by posting our predictions for new cars coming out within the next 1-2 years, in one easy to find place.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these are only predictions based on previous and current trends, usually with no first hand insider information unless otherwise linked/indicated.  These cars could be introduced sooner (or more likely, later) than originally thought, with different equipment or specifications than we predicted.  A final warning: although we try our best, this is by no means a comprehensive list! <a href="../new-car-predictions-1086.html#more-1086" class="more-link">

    <p>This month’s Road of the Month is once again back in SoCal, but with a more relaxed route. Just west of the famed Grapevine (the mountain pass between Bakersfield and Los Angeles) lies a road that barely even makes it onto the map. The little road is truly a path from nowhere, to nowhere. There are no big towns at the beginning, middle, or end of it &#8211; only some small farms and ranches. Since it&#8217;s so out of the way, very few people head this way for recreation. Hence, there is little traffic and even fewer patrols. Interested yet? <a href="../road-of-the-month-lockwood-valley-rd-socal-1070.html#more-1070" class="more-link">

    <p>If you were to ask a random American, “what is a proton?”, most would have only one answer. It’s that whatchamacallit with the positive charge inside an atom, right? And then they would nonchalantly stroll away, patting themselves on the back for being so educated. They have no idea how lucky they are that they don’t have that word associated with cars.</p>
<p>Proton also happens to be a carmaker from Malaysia, formed in 1983 by one of its former Prime Ministers. The Malaysian government indirectly owns a majority of the company. As a Malaysian, it pains me to say that they make some of the worst cars on the road. It hurts even more when you consider that it wasn’t always this way &#8211; at one time they were the dominant player in the Malaysian market. Their first model, the 1985 Proton Saga, catapulted the country into an age of attainable vehicle ownership. The up-to-date Mitsubishi underpinnings made the vehicle desirable because of its affordability and relatively new technology. In fact, this model garnered 73% of the new car market in Malaysia when full production commenced. <a href="../forbidden-crap-protons-929.html#more-929" class="more-link">

    <p>Since the introduction of computers into mainstream passenger vehicles in the 1980’s, the number of microprocessors in cars has grown like wildfire. High end European vehicles like the Mercedes S-Class contain as many as 100 microprocessors. These measure and control everything from accelerator pedal inputs to side-view mirror operation.</p>
<p>The core of the vehicle computers is known as the OBD-2 (aka OBD-II) system. The On-Board Diagnostics, 2nd generation system “speaks” a unified language that allows the car to communicate any faults to a technician. While OBD-II brought about many advancements in the car world, it also helped to gray the hairs of many shadetree and independent mechanics, not to mention dented the pocketbooks of many consumers.</p>

    <p>In a Playstation fantasy world, one where my driving abilities match the limits of my high strung super car, I would happily run sub eight minute laps around the Nurburgring track all day.  While I’m at it, I’d date the lovely Sabine Schmitz and draw love notes in the pavement with burned rubber and fill the air with the smell of high octane race fuel.  I’d do this all day, every day &#8211; until I managed to single-handedly convert all dinosaur remains to CO2 at wide open throttle. Global warming be damned. <a href="../why-the-nurburgring-sucks-596.html#more-596" class="more-link">

    <p>Unfortunately for the folks in Southern California, the good economy and urban sprawl resulted in the hills being filled with houses and restaurants. The more fortunate Northern Californians can rejoice in the fact that this trend has not spread to all of the San Francisco Bay Area yet. On the peninsula between the Pacific Coast Highway (known as Highway 1 in NorCal) and Interstate 280 lies a giant treasure trove of wonderful driving roads. Having personally logged thousands of miles on these roads, it is with great trepidation that these be shared on a blog with the world. But they’re just so amazing, and it’s always nice to share good things with the world!</p>

    <p>Every year or so, at least one car magazine produces an article about a bunch of sports cars that can be bought overseas but not in the United States.  Usually, I end up skipping those articles, because who really cares?  Even if they were available in the United States, the billionaires would buy one each and everybody else would drool from the sidelines.  Why not concentrate on the vehicles that everyday Joe’s would buy instead?</p>
<p>Truth is, the magazines have been shortchanging us by not writing about the vehicles we need to know about.  Vehicles like the Toyota Alphard and Estima minivans, which Toyota has insisted are not what American consumers want.  Well guess what?  My dad and I both love vans, and we both live in America.  We both agreed that the Japanese Alphard and Estima we drove in Malaysia were far nicer than the Toyota Sienna, which is not sold anywhere except North America.</p>

    <p>We’ve made friends with fellow car blogger Matthew over at <a href="http://www.drivecult.com">DriveCult</a>. The site’s full of awesome car commentary and reviews, but what grabbed our attention is Matthew’s long term test of a Ferrari Daytona.  Our inquisitive minds wanted to know what it was like to live the dream: driving around in a supercar everyday.  So, we asked.  And our friend delivered!</p>
<p><B>Tell us a bit about yourself.</B></p>
<p>	My name is Matt, I live in West London and I&#8217;m an Accountant for a pharmaceutical firm in Slough (where the original UK version of The Office was set). I&#8217;m married to the wonderful Danielle. In my spare time I write for multinational car site <a href="http://www.drivecult.com">DriveCult</a>, usually about my Daytona, or classic cars in general.</p>
<div id="attachment_1023" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/10/Daytona-1.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img src="../wp-uploads/2011/10/Daytona-1.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" title="Daytona-1" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Matt's Ferrari Daytona alongside his dad's 365GTC/4</p></div>
<p><B>How&#8217;d you get into cars?</B></p>
<p>Like many people, I got into cars through my Dad who is a massive petrolhead like me. When I was young instead of reading comics I used to read my Dad&#8217;s copies of Motorsport and Classic cars magazines. The first car I ever rode in was an Aston Martin DBS Vantage that my Dad owned when I was born, nothing like starting young I guess.</p>
<p><B>What was your first car?</B></p>
<p>My first car was a Vauxhall Nova 1.3SR (also known as an Opel Corsa in many countries). I bought it because at the time, it was the only remotely sporty car I could possibly get insurance for (insurance premiums for males under 20 in the UK are enormous I think I paid over £1,000 just to insure it back in 1991). I kept that for a couple of years before going to University, at which point I got a larger Vauxhall Cavalier 1.6L. I had that for about two years before a jump to a new BMW 316i coupe (again insurance precluded getting a bigger engined version). I loved that car and kept it for about 4 years and around 45,000 miles.  At 25, something rather more sporty was insurable and I traded the BMW for a Porsche 944S2. A brilliant car that was very expensive to run. I kept it that for around six years and forty thousand miles at which point it became just to uneconomic to run so I sold it (on ebay for rather more than it was probably worth) and brought another BMW 3 Series this time a 323i Cabriolet.  A year later I wasn&#8217;t really using the BMW much so decided to  sell it and go without a car for a short while (quite easy to do in London). I missed not having a car though, and brought Fiat Barchetta after couple of months. I kept that for a couple of years before deciding I needed a bit more power in my motoring, and traded it for an Audi TT 3.2 DSG. Fast, but a pudding when it came to handling. </p>

<div id="attachment_1017" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/10/Daytona-3.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img src="../wp-uploads/2011/10/Daytona-3.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" title="Daytona-3" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Matt's Audi TT 3.2 DSG</p></div>
<p><B>What&#8217;s in your current garage?</B></p>
<p>My company now gives me Alfa Romeo Mito (I sold the TT when I got this), boring little box of a car but it does do 40mpg how ever hard you drive it, and is an ideal size for London. When I want to play there is, of course, the Daytona.</p>
<div id="attachment_1020" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/10/Daytona-4.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img src="../wp-uploads/2011/10/Daytona-4.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" title="Daytona-4" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Alfa Romeo MiTo</p></div>
<p><B>With the background stuff out of the way, tell us about the Daytona!</B></p>
<p>Ha ha, I was wondering when you would get to the Daytona, or 365GTB/4 to give it its correct name. It was my Dad&#8217;s car he replaced the Aston with it a year after I was born (and the Daytona was also a year old for that matter). It was his first Ferrari and always my favourite one out of the twenty eight he has owned. Dad ran it as his everyday car for the first three years (and 30,000 miles) of his ownership. As all Italian cars did in those days the body started to corrode so Dad replaced it as his daily driver with another Ferrari a 365GT4 2+2 and set about having it restored for the first time. It was restored again in 1985 and then led a fairly quiet life as a classic until becoming mine when it and  I were thirty (it became mine on the understanding I didn&#8217;t sell it and leave it for my kids). It was originally Dino Blue but Dad had it changed to Rosso Chiaro at the first restoration. It&#8217;s pretty much a standard car although the power steering unit from a Ferrari 400 has been added as it&#8217;s a pig at very low speeds otherwise.</p>
<p><B>There&#8217;s a lot of classics out there, what makes the Daytona special to you?</B></p>
<p>The sentimentality for my Daytona has a lot to do with my love for my particular car, but also it is an awesome car to drive. When it was new it was the fastest car in the world (independently verified) with a top speed of 175mph. It was also pretty much the best GT/Supercar you could buy with excellent handling good driving position and even a usable boot. The Lamborghini Miura may have been more outrageous looking but it has a dreadful driving position which would mean I could never drive one for more than a couple of miles. It is also said to not handle that well particularly at high speed due to front end lift. The only other real rival was the Maserati Ghibli which has a far inferior mechanical specification than the Daytona You can read for more detail on my thoughts on driving the Daytona on Drivecult.</p>
<p><B>How do you find a mechanic that you trust enough to work on it? Or do you end up doing the maintenance yourself?</B></p>
<p>I&#8217;m very lucky there, the Daytona shares its garage with my Dad&#8217;s car collection, which is currently a 2009 Ferrari California, a 1997 Ferrari 550 Maranello, two 1972 Ferrari 365 GTC/4s (one RHD and the other LHD), a Porsche 964 and a 1967 Iso Grifo GL300 currently undergoing restoration. All the cars are looked after by our mechanic Vince. He worked at Maranello Sales (the UK Ferrari importer in the UK until it was recently brought in house by Ferrari) for thirty years and also has done a couple of stints working for the McLaren F1 team. In my opinion he is the best classic Ferrari mechanic in the UK, if not the world, and the only man Dad has ever met in thirty seven years of being involved with the car who can set up the Daytona&#8217;s six twin choke Weber carburetors to run properly. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m completely useless when it comes to maintenance under the bonnet something I really should address although probably on something a little simpler to work on than the Daytona.</p>
<p><B>Sean asks: Do you have any specific tips (beyond regular servicing) to keep an old car in good shape?</B></p>
<p>The easiest way in my book to keep a classic in good shape is to use it. If I&#8217;ve had a month or so away and get into the Daytona, it is very grumpy particularly on starting from cold with fouled plugs and not firing on all twelve cylinders.  After a few miles it gets better though. A lot of people forget that a car can deteriorate sitting still without all the fluids moving around the systems. I never understand why collectors want to pay a premium for low mileage cars, I bet they don&#8217;t drive as well as a similar car used regularly.  I do try and use the Daytona as much as possible, but still never as much as I would like too. I have managed a few trips to France taking the car to the Le Mans classic in 2008 and again in 2010. I hope to do a similar tour with it again next summer.</p>
<p><B>Johnny asks: How many hours a month do you spend on upkeep?</B></p>
<p>I think I really covered that earlier, but with the Daytona servicing and other maintenance is on an as needed basis. Vince is suggesting an engine out overhaul this winter which be the first serious work the car has needed in a while. One of the advantages of the car being in the family since nearly new is that you know exactly what has been done to it over virtually its entire life, and keeping on top of things has meant it has been contrary to what you might expect it is a very reliable car.</p>
<p><B>Congratulations on your recent marriage, what does the missus think of your car hobby?</B></p>
<p>Thank you, she&#8217;s cool with it actually. Her Dad is a petrolhead and fan of Corvettes (my wife is American) so it&#8217;s something she&#8217;s used too. She is not keen on the smell of petrol the Daytona can leave you with after a long journey though.</p>

    <p>The 2011 Honda CR-V is one hell of an oldie, but goodie. The five year old model is within months of a redesign, yet continues to post deliriously good sales figures. Of all the Honda models that had a full sales year in 2010 (ie. not introduced or redesigned in the middle of 2010), the 2011 CR-V posted the largest unit sales gains of the lineup from January through August. The CR-V also sold 60% more units than its main competitor, the Toyota RAV4, from January 2011 through August 2011.</p>
<div id="attachment_987" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/10/crv1.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img title="crv1" src="../wp-uploads/2011/10/crv1.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The redesigned 2012 Honda CR-V (concept model shown) puts Honda in the enviable position of replacing a vehicle that is still climbing the sales charts.</p></div>
<p>I’ve always wondered why the CR-V did so well. With competitors offering bigger interiors, more powerful engines with better fuel economy, and more standard/available features, you’d think the CR-V would be at the bottom of the list. After spending some time behind the wheel of a friend’s 2011 CR-V LX though, there are a few things that make it stand out as the vehicle of choice. It quickly became evident why the masses still flock to it.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Last week, I traveled to Mexico City and stayed for a week.  My girlfriend and I soaked in the hustle and bustle of city life, ate delicious foods, and explored the country’s rich history and culture.  At times, I wish I could turn off my car gawking &#8211; at the very least for vacation &#8211; but unfortunately I could not hold out.  The curse came with me everywhere I went, and I was forced to gawk at some really boring cars.  If Los Angeles is a car mecca of the world, then surely Mexico City is a car enthusiast&#8217;s purgatory. Read on for observations of Mexico’s best and worst rides.</p>
<p>One of the first cars I saw coming out of the airport was a full size Chevy Suburban.  Gasoline is nationalized in Mexico, so prices were all the same at different stations with a few exceptions.  I worked out the conversion to be $2.86 per gallon, which sounded like a smoking deal until I walked by a food stand that would sell me close to nine delicious tacos for that price. Would you rather travel nine miles in a Suburban in the city, or eat nine tacos?  Without hesitation, I would choose the latter because the street food is amazing.</p>
<p>Taking the ultra cheap, and ultra convenient metro ($0.25 takes you anywhere), it quickly became clear that the Suburban is not this city’s most common car.  There were many A and B segment cars, tiny subcompacts contributing to one of the most polluted cities in the world.  Most of them were nothing to write home about. A Ford Ka here, a Chevy Matiz there.  Every once in a while, a Audi A1 might make your head turn, but even that’s less exciting than even most compacts in the US.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/09/mexico1.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img src="../wp-uploads/2011/09/mexico1.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" title="DSCF4743" width="100%" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846" /></a></p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the car du jour in the gridlocked city was the mid 90’s 3rd generation Nissan Sentra, named the unpronounceable Tsuru locally.  Nissan has a strong showing in the Mexican market, and I would not be surprised if the redesigned 2012 Versa sells well here.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/09/mexico2.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img src="../wp-uploads/2011/09/mexico2.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" title="mexico2" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847" /></a></p>
<p>The other popular manufacturer in the country is VW.  There are many 4th generation Jettas out on the street, but the real surprise is the number of original VW Beetles.  The popular fleet Taxi used to be the original Beetle until the government banned 2-door vehicles in a successful attempt to phase out the air cooled pollution menace.  It’s a shame because it’s still fun to see and hear them drive down the street, even though if they are miserable cars compared to modern alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/09/mexico3.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img src="../wp-uploads/2011/09/mexico3.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" title="DSCF4727" width="100%" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848" /></a></p>
<p>So there you have it.  Mexico City’s a great place to visit, but has one of the most boring car cultures.</p>
