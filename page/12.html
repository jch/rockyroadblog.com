    <p>Living in a California metropolis is pure torture for a driving enthusiast.  It always seems like there is no escape from the prison of lousy roadways.  The streets are clogged with traffic, bad drivers and hot tempers.  Miles of arrow straight highways put drivers to sleep while the strategically placed potholes keep them from nodding off.  It’s more than enough to turn riders and drivers alike into mental patients.</p>
<p>That’s why I had to have a section dedicated to soothing roads.  You know the type: faint, squiggly lines on maps that no one cares about anymore &#8211; the public and the cops alike.  They would rather sit in traffic for 3 hours than to enjoy 4 hours of pure bliss.  And for that, we thank them &#8211; they keep the back roads clear for the rest of us to enjoy.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">A friend posed a riddle: How do I buy a car that doesn’t damage my hipster credibility?</span></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This riddle has been dramatized for your entertainment. The riddle asking friend is not a hipster. No hipsters were hurt in the writing of this article.</p>
<p>On the surface, this appears to be a facetious question.  But in reality, it’s a very real problem hipsters face.  To buy a mode of transport other than a fixed-gear bicycle is to commit hipster seppaku. Unfortunately, that stylish fixie is really just a very mediocre bicycle.  Without a car, the Hipster drastically limits what indie music venues she visits.  Without indie music, her carefully honed musical tastes would go unshared.  And most importantly, without a common social gathering place, where could she enjoy, genuinely and without irony, an ice cold Pabst Blue Ribbon?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/evolution_of_the_hipster.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-718" title="evolution_of_the_hipster" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/evolution_of_the_hipster-1024x675.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="560" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While the jury is still out on the merits of PBR, it’s clear that the hipster image is difficult to create, and takes constant vigilance to maintain.  A poor car choice could erase years of hard earned credibility and relabel a respected hipster to a mere yuppie sellout.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<div id="attachment_721" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/algaeus.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-721 " title="algaeus" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/algaeus.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Contestent #1</p></div>
<p>With these stakes in mind, the first hipster-mobile candidate is the Toyota Prius.  With it’s “saving the world” branding, it suits the Hipster mindset.  However, the Prius is only a solution to half the hipster problem.  Christian Lorentzen of “Time Out New York” once defined hipsterism as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Under the guise of &#8220;irony&#8221;, hipsterism fetishizes the authentic and regurgitates it with a winking inauthenticity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To be a successful hipster, every action one takes must be unarguably “authentic” in a literal sense, but also simultaneously shunned by the general public.  For example, the Lotus Elise is a car very true to it’s sports car aspirations.  Lotus’s founder, Colin Chapman, practiced his mantra of &#8220;To add speed, add lightness&#8221; in his cars.  As a result, any car enthusiast will inevitably use the words “pure” and “authentic” while describing the diminutive racer.  Yet authenticity is only half of the hipster equation.  A true hipster would not be seen driving an Elise because mainstream culture also covets it.  Therein lies the problem: a worthy hipster-mobile needs to be absolutely authentic in purpose, while being a complete flop in execution and sales.</p>
<div id="attachment_722" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/lotus-elise.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-large wp-image-722 " title="lotus-elise" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/lotus-elise-1024x768.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Great handing, but no iPod hookup to listen to the Decemberists...</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>Like the Elise, the Prius also has an authentic goal, albeit a non-sporting one.  Unfortunately, also like the Elise, the Prius soundly fails the second half of the requirements.  It’s been a runaway success around the world, with over 2 million units sold by the end of 2010.  It’s a good car and normal people want it, making it’s effective irony value nil.  So we’re back to square one.</p>
<p>With a 6-pack of PBR to synchronize my thinking with the thought process of a hipster, I started the search for the elusive hipster ride.  The new MiniCooper and the new Fiat 500 immediately failed the popularity test.  There was a glimmer of hope for the absolutely rubbish Smart ForTwo, but even that car has a cult following in urban areas.  Somewhere between beer five or six, I caved and asked my friend for the answer.</p>
<p>When the answer was revealed, it instantly clicked for me.  This mid-90s car had a clear purpose, which was to be economical and fuel efficient. At the same time, it still managed to be universally recognized as a terrible car.  What car was it?  If you have a guess, send it into contact@rockyroadblog.com.  The winner will receive a virtual pat on the back, as well as 200 Rocky Points.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Can&#8217;t figure it out? <a href="../2011/09/riddle-answer-the-ultimate-hipster-machine/index.html">Here&#8217;s the solution</a>.</p>

    <p>The story&#8217;s always the same: you wake up in an abandoned hospital. In your weakened state, you stumble down a hallway whose walls are filled with messages scrawled in blood.  Your stomach sinks as it slowly dawns on you that the rest of the world has been overrun by the undead.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the twist: what would you drive during a zombie apocalypse? Suppose you find the mangled body of Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear &#8211; his cold hands clutching a ring of car keys.  Inspecting the keychain shows that Mr. Clarkson had carefully considered his getaway options.  Some choices are obvious, like the Ford Raptor and Land Rover Defender, but the other choices are not.  You hear a faint growling from a distance, but the volume is growing at an alarming rate. You yank the entire keyring out of his hands and make a mad dash into the parking garage to make your final decision.</p>
<h2>#1 Ford SVT Raptor</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div id="attachment_662" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/raptor_jump1_1024x768.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-662" title="raptor_jump1_1024x768" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/raptor_jump1_1024x768.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Raptor smash, Raptor smush</p></div>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t care about cars, choosing a truck named &#8220;Raptor&#8221; is common sense when the undead start crawling towards you.  The Raptor is based on the most popular selling truck in America, the Ford F-150.  The frame has been widened by 7&#8243; and beefed up to handle off-road duties.  The skid plate and extra wide grille can be retrofitted to cause maximum zombie carnage.  Unfortunately, the mileage is so terrible that you&#8217;ll have to expose yourself to danger at every gas station.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: truck utility, hauls up to 8,000 pounds, general badass-ery.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: truck bed exposed to zombie attack. 13 MPG.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong>: Cool before the zombies came, cool when zombies arrives, and will remain cool even after all life ends as humans know it.</p>
<h2>#2 Jetta Sportwagon TDI</h2>
<div id="attachment_669" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/jetta_sportwagon_tdi.png%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-669" title="jetta_sportwagon_tdi" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/jetta_sportwagon_tdi.png%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Das Auto to escape ze zombies</p></div>
<p>Efficiency is probably at the bottom of your car shopping list with the undead hot on your heels.  However, gas stations will quickly be deserted.  While a hybrid Prius would yield great fuel economy numbers, the Jetta Sportwagon TDI is the smarter choice. The available diesel engine will reach hybrid-like MPG&#8217;s (up to 42 MPG), but can also burn waste vegetable oil.  This will allow you to sneak into McDonalds and use their deep-fryer grease as fuel in a pinch.  While you&#8217;re there, don&#8217;t forget to hoard what few chick McNuggets are left in this world in it’s spacious trunk &#8211; 67 cubic feet if you fold down the rear seats. That&#8217;s a lot of nuggets.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: good MPG, spacious wagon storage, heated seats, diesel powered</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: dodgy VW reliability, sporty rims a liability on unpaved roads</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong>: A stylish and good choice in urban areas.</p>
<h2>#3 “The Beast”</h2>
<div id="attachment_664" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/the_beast_limo.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-664 " title="the_beast_limo" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/the_beast_limo.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Don&#39;t be fooled, those flags are really zombie kill-sticks</p></div>
<p>Cadillac&#8217;s slogan of &#8220;Standard of the World&#8221; stopped being a true statement since Lexus came in and ate their market.  But this is no ordinary Cadillac.  In fact, the limo is built on top of a General Motors medium-duty commercial truck chassis, with the exterior and interior sourcing many parts from Cadillac.  Many defensive measures are built in including run flat tires, doors that weigh as much as Boeing 757 cabin door, tear gas from the front bumpers, and night vision.  Communication equipment is available, and the entire vehicle can be locked down like a vault.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: supreme comfort for up to 7 even post apocalypse, run flat tires, bullet proof (in case other survivors turn on you)</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: not enough ground clearance, too heavy, 8 MPG, lack of replacement parts, lousy breakover angle, no lift kits available</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong>: If it&#8217;s good enough for our president, it&#8217;s going enough for me.</p>
<h2>#4 Mid 90’s Beige Toyota Camry</h2>
<div id="attachment_665" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/beige_camry.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-665" title="beige_camry" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/beige_camry.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">yawn...</p></div>
<p>Ah, the nondescript Camry.  While it may not be fast or strong, it makes up for it&#8217;s deficiencies with a stellar reliability record.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: unlimited used parts. so bland that even a zombie won’t notice it&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: &#8230;your rescuers might not see you either</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong>: A unsexy, but sensible choice.</p>
<h2>#5 Land Rover Defender</h2>
<div id="attachment_666" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/land_rover_defender.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-666" title="land_rover_defender" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/land_rover_defender.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">zombie in headlights?</p></div>
<p>Used by militaries around the world, and also by hardcore off-road enthusiasts, the iconic Defender is ready for any physical challenge. With an attached snorkel, the Defender can ford across rivers.  It&#8217;s advanced oil system allows it to ascend and descend at extreme angles, and still properly lubricate all the essential drive components.  Built for durability, the Defender will go anywhere and last forever.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: tried and proven. sold in over 140 countries.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: spartan interior means rough winters</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong>: It looks like it belongs in a zombie movie.</p>
<h2>#6 Bonus Ride: Ferrari FF</h2>
<div id="attachment_667" class="wp-caption"><a href="../wp-uploads/2011/08/ferrari_ff.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-667" title="ferrari_ff" src="../wp-uploads/2011/08/ferrari_ff.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">let&#39;s drive to a desert oasis!</p></div>
<p>With all the doom and gloom in the air, why not take a deep breath and assess your situation.  Infrastructure has ground to a halt.  All modern conveniences have vanished or stopped working.  Odds are good that even if you play it safe, you&#8217;ll trip up one day and get a nasty bite when you least expect it.  So why not have a little fun before you get eaten.  The FF is the most &#8220;practical&#8221; Ferrari to date.  With seating for four, you can spend your last days with loved ones swathed in Alcantara. The trick AWD system means that you&#8217;ll be able to generate smile inducing hoonery even in sand and snow.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: The last toy on earth.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Sonorous Ferrari exhaust noises likely to draw unwanted attention. Every other attribute that makes an Ferrari awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong>: Live a little, the Ferrari won&#8217;t bite.</p>

    <p>Diesel. The word evokes memories of black soot shooting out of tail pipes. Or at least, that’s the diesel of yesteryear.  The rush to produce more fuel frugal engines during the early 70s’ oil crisis led to a large numbers of premature engine failures and a lasting legacy for the diesel engines years after the oil embargo ended.  The engines failed from poor lubrication, stress failures, and filtration systems that couldn’t handle potential water and unwanted particulates in the diesel fuel.  Some owners and mechanics, confused by technical differences, did improper maintenance and repairs that also caused premature failures.  Fortunately, those smelly and dirty memories of diesel are banished to the past with today’s modern diesel technologies like common-rail injection, advanced filtration systems, and consistent quality fuel.  Manufacturers have also wised up to make owners prove proper lubrication and maintenance before honoring their warranty.</p>
<p>While diesel may be the lifeblood of commercial transport, consumers in the market for a passenger car have only a handful of choices, and only the VW lineup being affordable to a middle income family.  The VW lineup of Golf, Jetta, Passat are available with the TDI (turbo direct injected) diesel engine.  The mileage numbers are impressive, with the Jetta able to squeeze out 30 mpg in the city and 42 on the highway.  Unfortunately for diesel fans, gas engines are undergoing a renaissance. Several new contenders in the sub-compact and compact segment are hitting 40 mpg highway, numbers previously reserved for diesels and hybrids.  Hyundai alone promises 3 non-hybrid gas models that will join the 40 mpg club (2012 Accent, 2012 Elantra, and the upcoming Veloster).  Chevy and Ford are both part of the 40 mpg club with the special edition Cruze Eco, and Focus SFE respectively.</p>
<p><center><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UbjVLo_vQ2I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p>Even with these impressive new choices, Chevy has confirmed that it will <a href="http://www.insideline.com/chevrolet/cruze/2011/2011-chevrolet-cruze-cdx-first-drive.html">bring a diesel version of it’s bestselling Cruze stateside</a>.  There’s no official EPA mileage numbers for the Cruze diesel, but with the Eco already certified for 40 MPG, it’ll be difficult to differentiate the two models.  It’s also likely that the diesel version will cost more than the Eco.</p>
<p>So a diesel passenger car costs more, isn’t more frugal at the pump, and doesn’t give perform better than it’s gasoline counterpart.  Oh, it also sounds like a tractor.  In the US market, the conditions just aren’t ripe for a diesel revolution.  And with so many efficient choices from competitors, diesel cars will always be a niche segment.</p>

    <p>Admittedly, I am one of the weirdest people ever to make it out of San Francisco alive.  My friends are still trying to figure out how I ended up as a right wing conservative, blasting country music in my diesel pickup.  I won’t comment about the other things, but I think my choice of transportation is actually perfectly acceptable by environmentalist ideals.</p>

    <p>“City cars,” ranging from the Smart to the Honda Fit (and equivalent subcompacts), are intended for use in urban areas.  Their popularity has steadily risen in Europe and Japan, thanks to highly developed rail systems and high vehicle ownership costs.  Manufacturers have been pleading with the American consumer to accept these city cars for years now. Only minor changes are needed to legalize these cars for sale in the USA.  That allows manufacturers to take advantage of the economy of scale, all while adding to the bottom line.</p>
<p>The problem is, though, city cars are one trick pony’s and will never catch on in present-day America.  Why?</p>

    <p>It was a scant few decades ago when an America infatuated with Detroit iron said that the Japanese made lousy cars and that they would never succeed. Today, nearly 40 years after Honda made its first foray into the four-wheeled market in America, those statements are holding more water than ever. After the collapse and revival of the American auto industry, as well as the uprising of the Korean carmakers, the dominant Japanese automakers (Toyota, Honda) are faced with a dwindling competitve edge.</p>

    <p>Each generation of video games promise more glitz and more glamour, but underneath those wow-you graphics, it’s rare to have a game with timeless game-play. Tetris is one such game. No matter how you dress it up, Tetris is at once both instantly familiar, and instantly addictive.  It’s controls are idiot proof, it’s goals simple and without gimmicks. People have derived new games from Tetris, but at it’s core, you’ll know a Tetris game when you see one.  And that’s exactly what defines a 2006 Scion xB: a successful set of functional tweaks to the Tetris formula.</p>
<p>Introduced in 2004, the first generation xB is a carryover of the Japanese market’s Toyota bB.  As one of the three launch cars for the brand, the first generation xB made a big splash in the news and backed it up with strong sales numbers (169,292 units) over 4 years of production.  Automotive journalists and auto enthusiasts were aghast at the xB’s lack of exterior styling, and the apt nickname “toaster on wheels” has stuck ever since. Love-it or hate-it opinions aside, everyone has an identical epiphany the first time they get into an xB</p>
<blockquote><p>“Wow, it’s really roomy in here”</p></blockquote>
<p>And that’s how it always starts. The birth of a raving xB lover.  That initial shock of the toaster’s spaciousness is the first step in explaining other eccentric xB design choices.  What’s with the shelf above the glove box? Ah yes, it happens to perfectly hold your passenger’s lunch.  That wacky central instrument cluster grows on you and becomes intuitive and natural over time.  Moving the cluster from it’s traditional location also frees up another shelf that’s perfect for holding toll change or a GPS device.  The rear passengers enjoy identical cavernous space thanks to the xB’s flat roof line.  Calling shotgun suddenly becomes an unfamiliar phrase.  The rear seats fold down 60/40 to make almost a flat floor.  With the front seat reclined fully, I’ve helped friends make IKEA trips to buy queen sized bed frames. As the complaints against the car grow faint and fainter, the xB’s strengths come to the foreground and those initial reservations are lost to a distant memory.</p>
<p>But before we go and live happily ever after, let’s look at some of the downsides of this toaster on wheels.  Around town, the ride is firm and manageable.  But for how stiff the ride is, the roll motions in a turn are pretty bad.  Not as bad as a floaty Camry, but not as controlled as a Mazda3 of similar vintage.  The turning radius is unbelievable large for such a tiny car.  Making a u-turn requires pulling deep into the center of the intersection for extra clearance.  No definite numbers, but it feels like our retired 1997 Nissan Quest made turns easier.  The 1.6L engine mated to a standard 5-speed manual transmission is nonsense-free and will happily run circles around town.  My RPM sweet spot is between 2000 rpm and 4000 rpm &#8211; pulls nicely, but doesn’t make a ruckus while doing so.  The exception is climbing up a hill with four passengers and a trunk stowaway.  Budget an extra 1000 rpm to pull all that extra weight.</p>
<p>For all it’s available dealer customizations, quiet motoring is unfortunately not on the list.  Once the xB gains speed on a freeway, you better pump up the volume on that 6 speaker Pioneer stereo (iPod hookup and steering wheel controls standard) to drown out the onslaught of noises.  First, the engine will struggle to get out of it’s own way with a measly 103 hp and 101 lb-ft of torque.  In the process, you’ll hear and feel that poor engine kicking and screaming to it’s 6500 rpm red line. Once at speed, the tires will provide a constant not-so-soothing droning baseline.  If you’re lucky, the wind buffets against that vertical windshield and a loud whoosing ensues.  If you’re not, then it’s probably raining and you’ll hear each individual drop smack against the thin poorly insulated roof.  That useful wide rear hatch that swallowed all your groceries suddenly becomes an amplifier.  A comfortable highway cruiser, this cheerful toaster is not.  To make matters worse, it’s also rather unsafe.  In fact, there’s so much red on <a href="http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=717">the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety review page</a>, it looks more like a shooting target than a review page.</p>
<p>So all listed downsides point towards the xB feeling cheap.  But that’s because it is cheap.  Retailing for less than $15k new, the xB packs a lot of standard features for it’s price.  With it’s Toyota Echo underpinnings, it’s a cheap car to maintain and reliable to boot. It’s no wonder that sales of the first generation xB increased every year through it’s production. The brilliant packaging and reasonable value eclipsed the cars’ shortcomings for many buyers. Sadly, the same can’t be said for the second generation.  On paper, the 2nd generation xB sounds like a better car: more power, less noise, better safety. But original xB owners feel the difference in their gut.  The charm of the original formula is gone and in it’s place, an ugly bloated blob of an appliance.  Straying from the classic no-frills Tetris was Scion’s mistake.  Here’s to hoping the company can recapture that excitement and charm with their upcoming iQ. In the meantime, I’ll stick with my darling toaster.</p>

    <p>Recently, Groupon offered members a chance to <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2011/07/13/groupon-offers-first-ever-deal-for-car-buyers/">pay $199 for a $500 discount towards the purchase or lease of a car from a Detroit dealership</a>. Skeptics bashed the deal from left and right, and a few days later, the facts were in and only <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2011/07/18/first-groupon-deal-for-autos-fails-miserably/">4 people had hopped on the deal</a>.  There are many reasons why this particular deal was such a flop. After purchasing the Groupon, the buyer is only reaping a measly savings of $301 out of the price of a car.  Even assuming you could find a ride for ten grand, that’s only a savings of 3%, a tiny number compared to the smoking double digit percent savings Groupon deals is known for.  On top of that, there’s no guarantee that the dealer won’t just roll the amount into the price of the car or financing.  There were too many variables involved for this car coupon to work out.</p>
<p>But before we chuck that idea out the door, let’s think harder about where a car coupon can make sense.  Social deal sites like Groupon and LivingSocial are the Internet’s latest craze.  By paying a small fee, a user can buy a coupon for significantly bigger savings from these sites. Once there are enough buyers for a deal, then the coupon is activated. Gen X/Y folks have been early adopters of these new deal sites. They are tweeting and buzzing about the latest deals, whether it be a cheap massage, or skydiving lessons.  While not all younger deal hunters are interested in cars, there’s plenty of interest from automakers to get them hooked on a brand early in life.  The brand that best epitomizes this sentiment is Scion.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scion_(automobile)#Target_market">median age of a Scion buyer</a> is a youthful 39 years old.  While that may not be the urban hipster seen in Scion’s edgy advertising, it’s a solid decade and a half younger than a geriatric median buyer age of 54 for parent company Toyota .  One of Scion’s selling points is a low no-haggle price.  The low price makes the cars affordable, and the no-haggle “Pure Price” keeps it simple for first-time car buyers. That was all sugar and candy until the recent wave of competitors in the sub-compact and compact segments.  The 2011 xB retails for a hair over $17k. For that kind of money, the typical broke college student has her choice of a Hyundai Elantra, a Ford Focus, or a Chevy Cruze for about $16.5k, give or take a few nights eating out.  All of these choices have been recently redesigned or newly introduced, while the xB has only gotten mild cosmetic refreshes since 2008. If we throw sub-compacts into the price fight, then it’s not even a close comparison.  Other manufacturers also allow their dealers to negotiate the sale price, instead of forcing a standard fixed price.  Haggling is stressful no matter what you’re buying, but with the potential to save hundreds to thousands and get a better car in the process, the smart money is to suck it up and haggle.  Even if absolute volume isn’t the top priority for Scion in their quest to increase youthful market share, having this much competition suddenly makes those “Pure Priced” Scions sitting on dealer lots a heavy financial liability.</p>
<p>Scion does currently offer a $1k incentive to recent college graduates and active military serviceman. Both these promotions are in line with their brand image, so they don’t risk alienating their next Gen X/Y buyer.  But with a lagging economy and so many tempting competitors, it makes sense for Scion to add more incentives. Slapping cash on the hoods would be the easy answer, but cash rebates are a temporary band-aid and sets a dangerous brand damaging precedent.  Instead, Scion should embrace a social and creative marketing strategy.  A $1k Groupon with playful game elements for current models would help move cars off lots, but more importantly, the deal keeps the Scion brand strong among the young segment of car buyers.  That’s what I call killing two money sinking birds with one stone.</p>
