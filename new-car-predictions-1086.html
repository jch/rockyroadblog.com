    <p>Fast paced times and ever-evolving technology has made it hard to keep up with the car market.  It seems like every other week, there is some new rumor or model introduction just around the corner.  This makes it almost impossible to decide when to buy a new car, especially if your current one is still going strong.  After all, who wants to plunk down 30 grand on a discretionary purchase, only to find out months later that they have last year’s news?</p>
<p>Fortunately, carmakers usually have some semblance of predefined schedules for model changes.  For example, Honda cars are typically redesigned every five years (changed from four years for models introduced before the new millenium).  Based on these model cycles and spy shots from around the world, accurate predictions are easy to make these days.  We’ve decided to help consumers by posting our predictions for new cars coming out within the next 1-2 years, in one easy to find place.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these are only predictions based on previous and current trends, usually with no first hand insider information unless otherwise linked/indicated.  These cars could be introduced sooner (or more likely, later) than originally thought, with different equipment or specifications than we predicted.  A final warning: although we try our best, this is by no means a comprehensive list!<span id="more-1086"></span></p>
<h5>Model Year 2013 introductions:</h5>
<p>2013 Acura ILX &#8211; This new model should be replacing the vaunted Acura TSX.  Instead of being based on an overseas version of the Honda Accord (as the TSX was), this model will be based on a North American version of the Honda Civic.  <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/02/07/2013-acura-ilx-puts-a-familiar-face-on-entry-level-luxury/">Expect a 2.0L  and a 2.4L 4 cylinder engine, along with a 1.5L hybrid model</a>.  The only model we&#8217;d recommend?  The 2.4L with a 6-speed stick.  The 2.0L model nets only 2 additional HP over the Elantra&#8217;s 1.8L, and gets significantly worse mileage (24/32 vs. 29/40).  The hybrid is a similar story &#8211; it gets a much better 35/38, but why would you put up with 111HP when the new BMW 328i has 240HP and still delivers 34MPG highway?  It makes no sense.</p>
<div id="attachment_1959" class="wp-caption"><a href="2011/12/new-car-predictions/predictions4/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-1959"><img class="size-large wp-image-1959" title="2013 Acura ILX 2.0L" src="wp-uploads/2011/12/Predictions4-575x383.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The 2013 Acura ILX, in 2.0L trim.</p></div>
<p>2013 Acura MDX &#8211; The MDX has always been introduced two model years after a new Honda Odyssey introduction.  The Odyssey was redesigned in ‘99, ‘05, and ‘11.  The MDX was introduced in ‘01 and redesigned for ‘07.  Hence, expect a new model for 2013.  We expect a newly developed 3.5L V6 with around 310HP, a possible seven-speed dual clutch gearbox (or a new <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/26/honda-working-on-nine-speed-automatic-transmission/">9-speed auto by ZF</a>), and some form of SH-AWD.  Bad news for detractors of recent Acura styling &#8211; we would expect some version of the infamous “shield” grille on the new MDX.</p>
<p>2013 Acura RDX &#8211; The little ute loses some of its character as it gets redesigned for 2013.  <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/02/07/2013-acura-rdx-gets-more-of-the-good-stuff/">The turbo 4 cylinder has been replaced with a 273HP 3.5L V6</a>, and the styling has been toned down considerably.  Test drives and reviews will tell a better story, but judging from the press releases and photos, we don&#8217;t see enough innovation in this trucklet to consider it a class-leader just yet.</p>
<p>2013 Audi Q3 &#8211; Autoblog reports that <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/01/09/audi-lifts-veil-on-q3-vail-concept-confirms-production-q3-for-n/">Audi is trying to launch the Q3 in 2013</a>, but we think it will arrive around fall 2012 as a 2013 model.  Delaying it would mean losing out to the new RDX, recently announced X1, and refreshed GLK350.  However, the plan could be derailed if European market demands are extraordinary, as in the case of the X1.  Our advice is to wait as long as possible for this promising little utility and its 314HP 5-cylinder engine.</p>
<p>2013 Audi Q6 &#8211; Mules of this vehicle have been spotted running around, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/21/audi-q6-mule-spotted-testing/">cold weather testing</a>.  Details are mum, but it sounds like it will be a competitor to the BMW X6.  Given that this model may not be ready until 2013 actually rolls around, we wouldn&#8217;t wait for it.</p>
<p>2013 BMW 3-series Coupe &#8211; The BMW 3-series has been completely redesigned for the 2012 model year.  Traditionally, BMW has followed up with a coupe version within a model year of the sedan’s introduction.  Aside from slightly different styling and identical drivetrains, look for a possible name change.  This new coupe is rumored to become the 4-series, falling in line with recent BMW nomenclature (eg. the 6-series is a 5-series coupe, the X6 is an X5 “coupe” &#8211; almost).</p>
<div id="attachment_1097" class="wp-caption"><a href="wp-uploads/2011/12/Predictions1.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-1097" title="Predictions1" src="wp-uploads/2011/12/Predictions1.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Speculative renderings of the 2013 BMW 3-series Coupe (4-series?). Make sure to check out Theophilus Chin&#39;s other works of art on his blog!</p></div>
<p>*Updated* 2013 BMW X1 &#8211; The long-awaited mini SUV has yet to appear on our shores, due to strong demand from the European market.  Recent statements by BMW have indicated that <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/25/bmw-promises-updated-x1-in-u-s-dealers-this-summer/">we may finally receive the Q3 competitor</a> in summer 2012.  Power should be provided by the 2.0L turbo 4-cylinder, producing 240HP.  The 300HP turbo-six is also available.  Styling inside and out should receive minimal changes.  Pricing <del>has not been announced, but we would be surprised if the base price was much over $32,000,</del> has been announced at <a href="http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2012/04/2013-bmw-x1-priced-from-31545-in-states.html">$31,545 for the turbo-4</a>, and we expect average transaction prices (including options) nearing $40K.</p>
<p>*New* 2013 Buick Enclave &#8211; The once award-winning SUV from Buick has <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/04/2013-buick-enclave-reveal-new-york-2012/">finally gotten the refresh it deserves</a>, and it can&#8217;t come soon enough.  A lightly updated front end and interior are the bulk of the changes.  The 3.6L V6 is going to carry over, as well as all the QuietTuning engineering built into the chassis &#8211; something that we sure appreciate.</p>
<p>2013 Ford Escape &#8211; <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2011/11/16/2013-ford-escape-la-2011/">Making its debut</a> at the 2012 Los Angeles International Auto Show, the new Escape debuts with a sleeker exterior and high tech interior.  MyFord Touch and Sync functionality are a given, as is AWD availability coupled exclusively with four cylinder engines.  Autoblog has confirmed the Escape will only be available with a 2.5L 4 cylinder, or 1.6L and 2.0L versions of the EcoBoost engine.  A six speed conventional automatic will be the only transmission available, which is good news for detractors of Ford’s dual-clutch autobox.</p>
<div id="attachment_1972" class="wp-caption"><a href="2011/12/new-car-predictions/predictions5/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-1972"><img class="size-large wp-image-1972" title="2013 Ford Escape" src="wp-uploads/2011/12/Predictions5-575x383.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The 2013 Ford Escape has been dramatically restyled with more European lines.</p></div>
<p>2013 Ford Fusion &#8211; The new car was introduced at the Detroit Auto Show in January 2012, and <a href="2012/01/2013-ford-fusion-preview-the-super-model-of-family-sedans/index.html">looks to be quite promising</a>.  A couple of new EcoBoost engines and sleek styling make it a real contender in the family car market, which available AWD gives it a huge advantage in the snow belt.</p>
<p>2013 Ford Mustang &#8211; The <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2011/11/17/2013-ford-mustang-boss-302-la-2011/">2013 Mustang</a> receives minor detailing changes.  Basic V6 and V8 models carry their drivetrains over from previous years, but the GT500 gains massive power: <a href="http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2011/11/new-ford-shelby-gt500-packs-monstrous.html">650HP from a 5.8L V8 mill</a>.  Long live the muscle car wars!</p>
<p>2013 Honda Accord &#8211; The Honda car lineup usually follows a five year redesign cycle.  The exception was the 2006-2011 Civic, which had an extra year tacked on to allow for major changes partway through the 2012 model’s development cycle.  Hence, the Accord (introduced as a 2008 model) should be completely redesigned for the 2013 model year.  If Honda wants to avoid botching another important product (as it did with the 2012 Civic), it will need to improve fuel economy.  <a href="http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111129/OEM01/111129906/1354">New 4 cylinder and V6 engines mated to CVT transmissions should get the job done while providing similar power</a>.  A 4 cylinder hybrid model is a certainty, and a plug-in hybrid to contend with the Fusion Energi is expected as well.</p>
<p>*Updated* 2013 Honda Civic refresh &#8211; The Civic was redesigned for the 2012 model year and normally wouldn’t be slated for a refresh until the 2015 model year.  However, <a href="http://www.thetorquereport.com/2011/12/hondas_ceo_takes_responsibilit.html">Honda has received lots of criticism for the 2012 Civic</a>, and is working furiously to remedy the situation.  We think the Civic is <a href="http://wot.motortrend.com/honda-admits-civic-and-other-cars-are-boring-plans-refreshed-models-for-2013-140651.html">likely to be introduced in </a><del><a href="http://wot.motortrend.com/honda-admits-civic-and-other-cars-are-boring-plans-refreshed-models-for-2013-140651.html">spring 2013 as a 2014 model</a></del> late 2012 as a 2013 model, bringing improvements to the harshly criticized interior and suspension.  A brand new 1.8L 4 cylinder is expected, with 10% better fuel economy.  A CVT transmission has also been rumored, but unconfirmed at this point.</p>
<p>*Updated!* 2013 Hyundai Elantra Coupe and GT (hatchback) &#8211; These model has all but been confirmed, as it has already been <span style="color: #000000;"><del>seen testing out in the wild</del> </span><a href="2012/02/2013-hyundai-elantra-gt-and-coupe/index.html">released</a>!  They are slated to be introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in February, and should be on sale by Spring 2012.  We’re guessing that the coupe will eventually offer a recently announced 1.6L turbo 4 cylinder with 204HP, to combat the Civic Si.</p>
<p>2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe &#8211; This model already has official pictures confirming its existence.  The makeover cuts quite deep, with a new interior, new bumpers, new lights, and new wheels.  The engines have been upped to <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2011/11/14/2013-hyundai-genesis-coupe-to-get-350-hp-v6-275-hp-turbo-four/">348HP for the V6 and 274HP for the turbo 4 cylinder</a>.  Both engines are available with either a six speed manual or a new eight speed automatic.</p>
<p>*Updated* 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe &#8211; 2012 is proving to be an exceptionally busy year for the advancing automaker Hyundai, with the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/04/2013-hyundai-santa-fe-2012-new-york/">Santa Fe SUV being one of its new vehicle introductions</a>.  Hyundai released 5 and 7 passenger versions of the Santa Fe at the same time, distinguishing the smaller of the two with a &#8220;Sport&#8221; suffix.  The 7 seater will have a 290HP 3.3L V6, while the Sport version is a four cylinder only affair with up to 264 turbocharged horses.</p>
<div id="attachment_2025" class="wp-caption"><a href="2011/12/new-car-predictions/predictions9/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-2025"><img class="size-large wp-image-2025" title="2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport" src="wp-uploads/2011/12/Predictions9-575x431.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport</p></div>
<p>*Update: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/01/09/2013-hyundai-veloster-turbo-detroit-2012/">Confirmed!</a>* 2013 Hyundai Veloster Turbo &#8211; Hyundai has announced a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2011/11/01/hyundai-confirms-veloster-turbo-upgraded-genesis-coupe-headed-f/">new 1.6L turbo 4 cylinder producing 204HP</a>.  However, they failed to mention which vehicles would be powered by this engine.  Bets are going on the recently introduced Veloster, which could benefit from a bit more power.</p>
<p>2013 Kia Forte &#8211; The Kia Forte has been sold in North America since 2009, but had been on sale in Korea for a year prior to that.  Thus, expect a <a href="http://www.leftlanenews.com/kia-forte-2013.html">redesigned 2013 Forte</a>.  A more sophisticated suspension and 40MPG are almost a certainty for the Elantra’s sportier sibling.  The new styling will bring the compact car more in line with current Kia styling, with a version of Kia’s new corporate grille.</p>
<p>*Updated: <a href="http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2012/04/first-official-photos-of-honda.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Carscoop+%28CARSCOOP%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">photo leaks</a>* 2013 Lexus ES350 &#8211; The Lexus ES has always been introduced alongside the Camry, which was redesigned for model year 2012.  Toyota may be delaying the launch of the new ES due to tsunami and Thai flood related parts shortages, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see it launch as a late 2012 model.  Like it’s sibling the Camry, expect the current 3.5L V6 and six speed automatic to soldier on, along with evolutionary styling.  Strict CAFE standards may lead Toyota to launch an ES250 as well,  with the Camry’s 2.5L 4 cylinder.  This move would make sense, as a similar 4 cylinder equipped ES is currently on sale in China.</p>
<div id="attachment_1974" class="wp-caption"><a href="2011/12/new-car-predictions/predictions7/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-1974"><img class="size-large wp-image-1974" title="2013 Lexus ES350" src="wp-uploads/2011/12/Predictions7-575x335.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The 2013 Lexus ES350 adopts a more athletic stance and the corporate &quot;spindle&quot; grill.</p></div>
<p>2013 Lexus RX350/450h &#8211; Lexus&#8217; little CUV that could is <a href="http://lexusenthusiast.com/2012/02/11/2013-lexus-rx-rx-f-sport-revealed/">about to get an update</a>, bringing it into line with the company&#8217;s new design language.  Changes shouldn&#8217;t cut much below skin level for much of the lineup, with the new &#8220;spindle&#8221; grill and more angular bumpers to match the new GS350.  A new F-Sport model will be launched with more aggressive styling and trim (interior accents, aluminum pedals, bigger wheels, etc).  Several new interior colors will also be available.  If you are in the market for an RX in the near future, wait it out &#8211; this one looks much better.</p>
<p>*Updated* 2013 Lexus LS460 &#8211; The previous generation Lexus LS (2001-2006) went for six model years, and 2012 will mark the sixth model year of the current LS.  With stiff new competition from BMW and Audi, expect a new LS in early-mid 2012 as a 2013 model.  A <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/20/are-you-the-next-lexus-ls/">teaser image by Lexus</a> has all but confirmed that a new LS is coming our way.</p>
<p>2013 Mazda CX-5 &#8211; The brand new CX-5 crossover is intended to compete with the likes of the Honda CR-V.  It is a small, car-based SUV propelled by conventional 4 cylinder power.  No V6 model is expected, as the goal is to keep the vehicle fun and efficient.  <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2013-mazda-cx-5-first-drive-review">Early reviews look good</a>, so consider it a serious contender to the vaunted CR-V.</p>
<p>2013 Mercedes A-Class &#8211; Mercedes is wagering that consumers will pay a premium for high tech in small cars.  Considering the rise in gas prices, the <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/future-cars/spy-photos/caught-before-geneva-2013-mercedes-benz-a-class">2013 A-Class</a> may be a well-timed bet, with the 2.0L inline-4 set to become the smallest engine in Mercedes&#8217; US lineup.  We&#8217;re not sure how this is going to work out, but 200HP in a premium small hatch/sedan sounds like a worthwhile experiment to us.  While it&#8217;s too early to set prices, we expect it to come in around $30,000.2013 Mercedes GL-Class &#8211; The three-pointed star’s 3 row crossover gets a <a href="http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2011/12/spied-mercedes-benz-three-row-2013-gl.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Carscoop+%28CARSCOOP%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">mild makeover</a> for 2013.  Now based on the smaller M-Class, <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/20/mercedes-benz-to-bring-next-gen-gl-class-to-new-york/">expect similar engine choices</a> &#8211; a diesel V6 and a couple of V8’s.  The gas V6 may not make it into this high class SUV for the US market.</p>
<p>*Updated* 2013 Nissan Altima &#8211; The Altima has been on sale in its current form for seven model years now, an eternity for a field where four to five years is the norm for complete redesigns.  Expect <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2011/08/25/2013-nissan-altima-taking-shape/">a new model</a> by Fall 2012 (if not earlier), with the 3.5L engine soldiering on with only minor modifications.  Nissan has quashed rumors of a 2.0L turbo 4-cylinder, as they have managed to <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/03/2013-nissan-altima-new-york-2012/">improve the current 2.5L 4-cylinder to the tune of 38MPG highway</a>.  The impressive MPG is likely the result of a super-efficient CVT transmission, the only transmission available on the new Altima.</p>
<div id="attachment_1975" class="wp-caption"><a href="2011/12/new-car-predictions/predictions8/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-1975"><img class="size-large wp-image-1975" title="2013 Nissan Altima" src="wp-uploads/2011/12/Predictions8-575x351.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="100%" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nissan took a careful but tasteful evolutionary styling approach with the 2013 Altima.</p></div>
<p>2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek &#8211; Based on the Impreza hatchback, this model leaves the Outback moniker for the larger Legacy-based wagons to handle.  The Crosstrek will use <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/22/subaru-confirms-debut-of-u-s-xv-crosstrek-for-ny/">the same chassis and 148HP engine as the Impreza</a>, but the 8.7 inches of ground clearance will help in deep snow.  Expect more news to trickle out at the New York International Auto Show, including pricing information.</p>
<p>*Updated* 2013 Toyota Avalon &#8211; It seems like Toyota may be digging deeper than a minor refresh for this model, as they have recently promised a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/02/08/next-toyota-avalon-to-best-fiat-500s-fuel-economy/">new Avalon that will best the current Fiat 500 in fuel economy</a>.  With the 500 currently getting 30/38 with a manual and 27/34 with the auto, it&#8217;s clear that Toyota is not resting on their laurels.  <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/05/2013-toyota-avalon-2012-new-york/">With the new car being lighter, smaller, and sportier than its predecessor</a>, it seems Toyota won&#8217;t let a newly-resuscitated Buick take over its forever stronghold.</p>
<p>2013 Toyota Venza &#8211; The quirky wagon-SUV is due for a minor refresh, and <del>a <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/07/toyota-teases-2013-venza-set-for-debut-in-new-york/">teaser image by Toyota</a></del> new <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/03/2013-toyota-venza-refreshed-entune-optional/">photos by Toyota</a> show it to be very minor.  Engines and drivetrains should remain as they are, with the only changes going to minor trim, bumpers, lights, wheels, and the like.  Expect it to be on sale before summer rolls around.</p>
<p><strong>Model Year 2014 introductions:</strong></p>
<p>*New* 2014 BMW X5 &#8211; <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/01/17/next-gen-bmw-x5-caught-again/">Details are scarce on the 2014 X5</a>, but expect it to have 6 and 8 cylinder power coming from the corporate mills.  We reckon the twin-turbo 6 cylinder will produce around 300HP, with the twin turbo V8 coming in at 400HP.  A diesel should be in the cards to help improve the company&#8217;s CAFE numbers, which the new 2.0L 4-cylinder turbo is unlikely due to the X5&#8242;s size.</p>
<p>*Updated* 2014 Chevrolet Corvette &#8211; There is still a ton of speculation over what the C7 Corvette will be like.  As with many prior Corvette introductions, there have been rumors of mid engine, rotary, V6, etc.  We think that this classic American icon will continue on by evolving, keeping its 2-door hatchback, front-engine RWD 2 seater layout intact.  <a href="http://jalopnik.com/5858683/exclusive-this-is-the-2014-chevy-corvette">Renderings</a> from our friends at Jalopnik have confirmed this by looking at the proportions &#8211; the long hood indicates there will be an engine up front.  *Update: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/01/19/chevy-corvette-c7-prototype-spied-testing/">new spy shots!</a>*</p>
<div id="attachment_1099" class="wp-caption"><a href="wp-uploads/2011/12/Predictions3.jpg%3F9d7bd4"><img class="size-large wp-image-1099" title="Predictions3" src="wp-uploads/2011/12/Predictions3-1024x576.jpg%3F9d7bd4" alt="" width="560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rendering of 2014 Corvette based on actual models seen inside GM.</p></div>
<p>2014 Chevrolet Impala &#8211; A new Impala based on the Cadillac XTS chassis is due to show up at the New York International Auto Show.  <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/21/new-york-auto-show-confirms-2014-chevy-impala-debut-via-facebook/">GM has shown several teaser images</a>, but nothing substantial.  Expect the large FWD sedan to be powered by a V6 (and possibly a 4 cylinder); a V8 will likely be saved for a larger, unannounced RWD sedan in the near future.</p>
<p>2014 Honda Fit &#8211; The current Fit was introduced as a 2009 model in the North American markets, but had already been on sale for over a year in overseas markets.  Hence, a new Fit is expected sometime in 2012 as a 2013 model, with the North American models coming a year later.  Look for more fuel efficient, newly designed 1.5L 4 cylinder mated to a 6 speed manual or a CVT.</p>
<p>2014 Hyundai Genesis (sedan) &#8211; The Korean carmaker&#8217;s first attempt at a <a href="http://www.egmcartech.com/2012/03/21/report-hyundai-sonata-redesign-coming-in-2014-genesis-in-2013/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+egmcartech+%28egmCarTech%29">luxury entry will be revamped in late 2013</a>, if Hyundai&#8217;s CEO is correct (we think he&#8217;s credible).  The 429HP 5.0L Tau V8 should be continuing on, perhaps with a little bit more horsepower.  A V6 is a given, but it may be downsized and turbocharged to keep pace with the times.  Given Hyundai&#8217;s current rate of learning the market, the new Genesis should be a contender for the luxury crown.</p>
<p>2014 Hyundai Sonata &#8211; Assuming a 4 year product cycle, the new Sonata would be out in late 2013 as a 2014 model.  If Hyundai adopts a 5 year cycle, then it <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/21/revamped-hyundai-sonata-due-in-2014/">could be introduced as a 2015 model</a>.  Nonetheless, expect a more refined ride with better 4-cylinder only engine offerings.  A hybrid model is likely, and an EV model will likely be available as well.</p>
<p>2014 Lexus IS250/350 &#8211; The first generation IS (known as the Altezza in some overseas markets) was allowed to go for eight model years before being redesigned in overseas markets.  Assuming the same time scale for the current model, which has aged a bit since its last redesign in 2006, the next IS should be showing up as a 2014 model.  Look for similar engines and transmissions.  The AWD models are probably here to stay as well, since many competitors offer AWD on their entry-level luxury sedans (G37x, Audi A4 Quattro, BMW 328xi, etc).</p>
<p>*New* 2014 Mazda Miata &#8211; Road &amp; Track has started putting out <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/future-cars/first/2014-mazda-miata">details on the 2013 Miata</a>.  They&#8217;re predicting a lighter chassis with a turbocharged 1.3L mill using SkyActiv technology.  While they predict that the 1.3L will be significantly lighter than the current 2.0L engine, we wonder whether the turbo&#8217;s added complexity wouldn&#8217;t make any weight savings a wash.  Nonetheless, we have faith that Mazda engineers will do right by the Miata name, and produce another category-dominating roadster.</p>
<p>2014 Subaru Forester &#8211; A new Forester is in the works for 2014, and it follows the trend of bigger is better.  Details are scarce, but after checking the comments in these <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150290474002421&amp;set=a.212126637420.132972.212116397420&amp;type=3&amp;theater">spy shots</a> and other sources, expect it to be wider and longer, with bigger wheels to keep proportions in check.</p>
<p>2014 Subaru WRX/STI &#8211; Subaru is rumored to be <a href="http://www.motortrend.com/future/future_vehicles/1107_subaru_wrx_to_go_its_own_way/">separating the Impreza from the WRX/STI models</a>.  These hi-po models will receive unique styling, platforms and engines for the 2013 model year.  Expect around 270HP for the WRX and a touch over 300HP for the STI model.</p>
<p>2014 Toyota Corolla/Matrix &#8211; Toyota’s compact car was last redesigned for model year 2009.  With Toyota cars being on five year cycles, the new Corolla should be introduced as a 2014 model, with the Matrix following close behind.  Look for it as early as Spring 2013, as Toyota has a habit of early model introductions (the 2009 Corolla made its debut in January 2008).</p>
<p>2014 Toyota Sienna refresh &#8211; 2014 marks the fourth model year of the current generation Sienna, which means it should receive subtle revisions to the exterior and interior (vans/SUVs/trucks follow longer timescale than cars at Honda and Toyota).  No drivetrain details are expected to change.</p>
<p>2014 Toyota Tundra &#8211; Assuming a reasonable 7 year run for the current generation Tundra, a new model should be introduced for the 2014 model year.  A concept introduction or leakage of engineering details in 2012 would confirm this.</p>
<p>*New* 2014 Volkswagen Golf &#8211; This model has been much anticipated, as it is underpinned by the new MQB chassis.  Due to the flexibility of the chassis, it is anticipated that the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2012/02/03/what-we-know-about-the-2013-volkswagen-golf-next-gen-gti/">new Golf </a>will be a very refined drive.  Completely new gas engines should replace the tired 2.5L inline-5 from past generations.  The diesel option will likely be the high-tech 2.0L unit from the current USDM Jetta and Passat.  Alternative fuel options (gas-electric hybrid, full EV models, etc) are guaranteed, though may be rolled out after the higher volume models are launched.</p>
