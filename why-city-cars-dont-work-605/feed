		<description>My Mito is a good looking car (although not in the league of my Ferrari :-). Mine is a fairly early one and doesn&#039;t benefit from the so called multi air engines that are more powerful and more efficient for the equivalent engine size (1.4 litres in mine).  It&#039;s a good car for it&#039;s type and has excellent fuel economy (at least 40mpg imperial however hard you drive it), but has a terrible ride compared to say the Renault Clio, mainly because I think Alfa have bench marked the Mini as it&#039;s chief rival.  The Mito is sold alongside the 500 in the UK and I don&#039;t see why it wouldn&#039;t so the same in the US, but then I&#039;m not a Fiat product planner :-)

I&#039;ve not tried the Giulietta but would agree that it is the better looking car.</description>

		<description>I simply Google&#039;d something like &quot;average UK driver miles per year&quot; (or something to that effect) and the first couple results I got had indicated ~9000mi/year.  I didn&#039;t dig too far into it, and after some more research I can see 12K is a reasonable estimate as well.  And, yes you are correct that smaller cars are nice to drive on narrow winding roads.

Regarding the example of Renault Modus vs. Volvo 940, it is a skewed example.  For one, the kerb weights are not significantly different - 1536kg vs 1185kg (from sources I found).  Remember, not only does the passenger compartment have to hold up, but the g-forces have to be low enough to protect the occupants brains and internal organs.  If you use the conservation of momentum theory to do some calculations you come up to this conclusion: the force of the head-on collision is equivalent to the Volvo heading into a stationary wall at 71MPH, or the Modus heading into the same stationary wall at 92MPH.  Really, this was more a test of how far crumple zones and chassis stiffness have evolved in the last 20 years.

That&#039;s not pretty, but here&#039;s a more extreme, more real life example that I face.  I live in a desert where the only road to work is one lane in each direction, and it&#039;s chocked full of tired people after a 12 hour shift, with the sun in their eyes, trying to pass others so they can get home quicker.  People here like to tow 10,000-15,000lb caravans on vacation and go off-roading, so over 1/2 of the parking lot at work comprises of full size trucks, with many being heavy duty F-250/350 type deals.  My particular truck is the lightest of the heavy duty&#039;s and weighs 7500lbs or about 3400kg.  Also at work, we have commuter cars - I often see a new generation Honda Jazz, for example.  According to Honda USA, it weighs ~1160kg.  In this example, the force of such a head on collision with each vehicle doing 40MPH is this equivalent to my F-250 heading into a wall at 54MPH.  The Jazz would have an equivalent speed of 158MPH.

Even if the Jazz passenger compartment could successfully hold up, the g-forces from going 160MPH to zero in a heartbeat could easily kill all the occupants.  And remember, this example is just at 40MPH.  If I increase the speed of each vehicle to 60MPH (speed limit 55MPH on the road to work, most drive 65-75), the truck would have an equivalent wall speed of 80MPH, while the Fit would have an equivalent speed of 237MPH.

Just food for thought - obviously the carmakers have done a good job engineering the smaller cars safely, and they promote this fact extremely well.  However, real life situations are not always as simple as they make it sound :)</description>

		<description>Scary crash video, but a good wake up call about crash safety improvements in recent times.  With the Fiat and Chysler merger, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see the reintroduction of the Alfa brand in the US. The Mito is a good looking car - it looks like a shrunk 8C from certain angles - but personally I&#039;d prefer it if they brought over the Giulietta. Not sure about the size difference between a Fiat 500 and a Mito, but there might be some overlap in sales there. I see a lot of 500s in LA. They&#039;re cute little cars.</description>

		<description>A few things, not sure where you got you stats from but I&#039;m pretty certain average mileage in the UK is closer to 12,000 not 9,000. I cover around 15,000 miles a year in my daily drive Alfa Mito (which I think may be coming to the US in a year or two), and is very much the city car you are referring too.

One thing you have not mentioned is that actually many small city cars are great fun to drive. Maybe not on a long boring straight road, but as soon as things get twisty they are way more chuckable than larger saloons.

On the subject of safety I would have agreed with you until Fifth Gear in the UK crash tested a Renault Modus City car against that perceived titan of safety the Volvo 740. The surprising results are on the You Tube link. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86M_fV-1yKY While buying the larger car is still safer a modern city car is infinitely safer than even a much larger 10 year old car.</description>
