		<description>At the same time though, many luxury car manufacturers are moving towards the &#039;we will take care of everything for the driver&#039; type of service, so that the owner does not have to work under the hood. I wonder if it will eventually evolve into a single warning light or message, to take the car in to the shop, whether it be your tire pressure, windshield washer fluid, oil change or transmission fluid and completely separate the driver from any maintenance of the car.

Who knows? Maybe the speedometer will change to a warning light: &quot;Too fast&quot; if you&#039;re driving faster than 65, &quot;Too Slow&quot; if you&#039;re driving less than 25 and &quot;You&#039;re going to get a ticket!&quot; if you drive over 75 :)</description>

		<description>Jerry - the blue dot/red dot is better than a gauage because it takes up almost no space.</description>

		<description>I have a perfect example of this.  My 2006 xB doesn&#039;t have a temperature gauge. Instead it just has a blue dot when it&#039;s cold, and a red dot when it&#039;s overheating.  How is this better than a simple dial?</description>
