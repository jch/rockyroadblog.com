		<description>After a truck cuts you off and then merges back to into the right lane is the perfect opportunity to test your car&#039;s acceleration, since the road in front will be empty.</description>

		<description>I try to be a little extra courteous to truck drivers, I figure they have to put up with a lot of bad drivers, the ones who speed, zip in and out of lanes and cut people off. I&#039;ll keep these tips in mind when I&#039;m commuting!

I like the idea of flashing the hazards once or twice to say thank you, it would be nice if there was another way to say thanks to the person that lets you into the lane you want!</description>
