		<description>I would personally say cars like the Jaguar XF have no business testing on the Nurburgring.  I believe the majority of cars tested there could be calibrated on public roads or private test tracks, and would do just fine.</description>

		<description>I love the sound of that high revving engine. I would find the nearest and longest tunnel, roll down the windows, and picture myself as Sebastian Vettel.</description>

		<description>I suspect Toyota has more then enough cash to develop the LFA and a new MR2 although looks like they are more interested in doing the FT-86 instead. As the FT-86 looks like it will have a lot of styling clues from the LFA you can think of it as a fantastic piece of advertising for the new car that a few lucky people will get to own. I would have an LFA in a heartbeat if I won the lottery. </description>

		<description>Hey Mattew,

Good to hear from you again. I come off a bit harsh and do more than my share of finger pointing.  I mean no disrespect for the RIng (someday, I hope to visit it myself).  What gets under my skin is how auto brands obsess with building halo cars unavailable to the unwashed massed (me). Case in point: I cringe to think of the development budget for the Lexus LFA.  I have no doubts of it&#039;s capabilities on the track, and on the road. But what if Toyota had spent the same engineering and marketing sweat and blood and put it into reviving an MR2?

As far as disdainful looks from the opposite sex, pick any *bright* yellow version of any car that can run the ring in sub 8 minutes. ;)</description>
